# Kickstarting My Journey
This repository contains the very first website that I made, my practice file, all of them. It's quite lame but I'm glad I started it.<br><br>

And apparently after the exam, I started learning how to do deface, and web penetration, and make some deface script. What a fool I was back then.
<br><br>
## Experiment One
For god sake this one is the lamest web that I've ever created. This is where I started to take deep interest in Frontend development.<br><br>

<br><br>
## Experiment Two
See this? I'm getting better at it. I remember this one, I tried to make an anime blog, and I can't do that before. <br><br>

## Script One
Oh my god! I just can't believe I'm that stupid, lol xD. <br><br>

<br><br>
## Script Two
At least this one looks better in my opinion. Now I know why I'm interested in web development. <br><br>
